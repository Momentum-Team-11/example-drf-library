# DRF Library API

This application is an API built with Django REST Framework (DRF) that lets users track books that they want to read or are reading -- kind of like GoodReads. Books are listed with important information like title, author, publication date, and whether it is marked as “featured”.

Any logged-in user can add a new book as long as the same book is not already in the library. Only admin users can update book details (like marking it as featured) or delete books.

Books are be unique by title and author (that is, you can’t have two books with the same title and author; two books with the same title is fine as long as the authors are different).

Users can mark a book as “want to read”, “reading”, or “read/done”.

Users can also write reviews on books, which should be viewable to all users. Optionally, users can take private notes on books.

**All requests, except registration and log in, require authentication**.

## Required Headers

Requests to endpoints requiring authentication should set the `Authorization` header to `Token <token>`, where `<token>` is the token received in the login response.

POST requests with a body should set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`.
